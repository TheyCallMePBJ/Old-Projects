# What is this?
Just a compilation of projects I made in Python during my high school years. I didn't learn Python in school, kinda just learnt on my own from various online sources.

# What are each of the Projects for?
## Grade X Pre Release.py
This was created in order to prepare for my 2022 IGCSE Board Exams. It was written to do everything asked of by the tasks in the pre release material for the 2022 Feb/March examination session.

## CustomBFP
This folder contains multiple edited versions of Brute Force Pyton by Sourabhmishra-23. They were edited to use for real world evaluation of my Mathematics IA, in early 2024.

### CustomBFP.py
This was my initial edit, a couple simple changes to the code.

### Custom Brute Force Python.py
This was the second edit, made due to repeated crashes while running the previous version.

### CustomBFPwithCheats.py
This was the final edit, made due to even more crashes. This one outputs the counting rate rather than the time taken, as I used it to approximate the time the code would take rather than actually running it (had to do this cause the program would have taken too long to run, especially for the higher complexities).
